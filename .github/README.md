## Intro

The SDK is intended for developers whose goal is to implement Unique Network functions avoiding working with a low-level blockchain API.
This SDK may be used as an npm package or REST API.

## How to start

Add SDK to your JavaScript/TypeScript project with

    npm install @unique-nft/sdk

or deploy your own SDK as HTTP REST Service with

    docker run uniquenetwork/web:latest

You can also use [Public endpoints](../packages/web#public-endpoints).
To learn more read [SDK Deployment guide](../packages/web#sdk-deployment---getting-started-guide): [Docker](../packages/web#docker), [Git](../packages/web#git).

## Packages

### SDK

[SDK package](../packages/sdk) contains npm package of SDK itself.

### Accounts

[Accounts package](../packages/accounts)

### Web

As an alternative to the whole SDK, you can use proxy http servi—Åe for SDK to implement server logic - [HTTP API Service](../packages/web).
It is created to interact with the blockchain using simple HTTP requests.
In general, this service provides the following functions:

1.  [Building an unsigned extrinsic](../packages/web#build-unsigned-extrinsic)
2.  [Extrinsic signing and verification using service (These functions should be implemented on client for safety)](../packages/web#sign-an-extrinsic)
3.  [Submitting an extrinsic](../packages/web#Submit-extrinsic)

HTTP API Service also allows to upload images using IPFS, can be used with existing public nodes or with your own private nodes.
Use [service documentation](../packages/web#readme) to learn its methods.

## Recipes

[Here](../recipes) you can find some useful hints or life hacks that will ease using of SDK.
